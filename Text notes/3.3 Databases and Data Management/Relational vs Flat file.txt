~ Difference between Flast file and Relational DB
	- Flat-file has no way to link info between separate files, unless a program is written
	  Relational allows linking through tables and relations

	- Flat-file requires a program to be rewritten if there are any changes to the fields
	  Linking in Relational is easy
	
	- Flat file is program oriented
	  Relational is data oriented

~ Advantages of RDB approach
	> Data independence
		- changes to structure of DB does not affect programs that access the data
		- Contrast to Flat file: A minor change may mean considerable reprogramming effort (Data Dependency)

	> Consistency of data
		- Each data is only held once, meaning there are no danger in an item being updated on one system and not another
	
	> Control over redundancy
		- redundancy is minimised
		- Contrast to Flat file: Waste space as of the dame data is held in separate files and takes more time to update (Data redundancy)

	> Greater security and integrity of Data
		- RDB only allows authorised users to access data
		- Contrast to Flat file: Data stored in multiple files, making it difficult control who has access and change data on the files
		  (Data privacy and integrity)

	> Increased productivity and more info available to user
		- RDB provides an easy to use query language to enable users to get instant answer to their queries
		- No need to write a special program to access data which requires time

~ Disdvantage of RDB approach
	> Larger size
		- Requires more space
		- Requires a stronger PC

	> Greater complexity
		- Must be Carefully designed
		- Requires considerable expertise

	> Possible inefficiency or poor performance
		- Might be less efficient than a tailor made program

	> Greater impact of system failure
		- if system fails, everyone using it will be affected

	> More complex recovery procedure

~ Disadvantage of Flat file approach
	> Data Dependency

	> Data Redundancy

	> Data Privacy

	> Data Integrity
