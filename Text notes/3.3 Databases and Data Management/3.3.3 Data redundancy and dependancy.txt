3.3.3 Explain with examples, the concept of data redundancy and data dependency.

~ Data redundancy
	- Is a data organisation issue that allows unneccessary duplication of data within the database
	- Is a disadvantage in a flat-file database

~ Data inconsistency
	- Exists when different and conflicting version of the same data appear in different places
	- Is a disadvantage of a flat-file database
	- If data is stored more than once, it may have 2 or more versions of different data.
	- Is a result of data redundancy and partial update

~ Update anomaly
	- Data Inconsistency

~ Insertion anomaly
	- The inability to add data to the DB due to the absence of another data
 	- Eg: record contains (title, booknumber), booknumber cannot be a null value,
	      when only the title is being insert, it cannot be added due to having missing the booknumber

~ Deletion anomaly
	- Occurs when a record is deleted that may contain attributes the should not be deleted
