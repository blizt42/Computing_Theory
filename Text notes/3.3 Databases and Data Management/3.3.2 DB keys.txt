3.3.2 Explain the purpose of and use primary, secondary, composite and foreign keys in tables. 

~ Primary key
	- #A primary key UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES each RECORD in a table and should not change over time.
	- #A primary key cannot be a NULL value
	- #A table can only consist of one primary key, and in the table, this primary key can consist of a single or multiple columns

	- Each record needs to have a unique identifier, hence a field is chosen to be unique (primary key)
	
	- A primary key is an attribute in a relation DB that acts as an unique identifier for each record
	- This is the means by which data from different tables are related/ linked
	
	- If primary key contains more than one attribute, it is considered to be a composite key

~ Foreign key
	- A field in a relational table that matches with the primary key of another table

	- A foreign key is an attribute in a relational table that matches the primary key column of another table in the same DB
	  Therefore, a foreign key should not contain data that do not appear in table it refers to

~ Difference between primary key and foreign key
	- Primary key does not allow duplicate and null values
	  Foreign keys allow

~ Composite key
	- #A composite key is a COMBINATION OF 2 OR MORE FIELDS in a table that can be used to unique identifier each reacord in a table.
	   Uniqueness is only guaranteed when the fields are combined.
	   When taken individually, the fields do not guarantee uniqueness	

~ secondary key
	- Any field that is not a primary key/foreign
	- Usually indexed fields
