3.3.11 Explain the difference between backup and archive.

~ Backup
	- A duplicate of an existing file which is still in use
	- It is created and kept as a security measure ( when main file fails, the backup can help restore the file )

~ Archive
	- The storage of information for a long period of time
	- Compressed to take up less space so that it can be stored in a cheaper medium
	- free up space in the main computer
	- Harder to access than the original information
	- Contains data no longer in use

~ Backup and archive
	- Both files are stored away from the main computer in a secure location
	- Archive serves to store data for historical purposes while Backup serves to replace the original data when in failure
