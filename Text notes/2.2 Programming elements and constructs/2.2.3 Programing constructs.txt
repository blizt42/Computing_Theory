2.2.3 Apply the fundamental programming constructs to control the flow of program execution:
	– Sequence
	– Selection
	– Iteration 

~ Sequence
	- Straight forward instruction one after another

~ Selection
	- Presentation of a condition
	- Invokes an action out of other actions depending if the condition is True or False
	- IF-ELSE statements

~ iteration
	- Presentaion of a set of instructions to be repeated as long as a condition is True
	- DOWHILE, REPEAT_UNTIL, FORLOOP
