2.2.1 
Understand the different types: integer, real, char, string and Boolean and initialise arrays (1-
dimensional and 2-dimensional). 

~ integer
	- Eg: -37, 0, 23, 123213

~ real/float
	- Eg: -12.5 , 0.0, 1243.324
	- 0.0 != 0 even though they are the same value

~ Boolean
	- Eg: True, False

~ character
	- a letter, number, or special character typically represented in ASCII
	- Eg: 'a', 'B', '$'

~String
	- Eg 'hi', 'I want to cry', '@#$%'
	- '6' can be counted as a character data type
