2.2.5 Understand the concept of recursion. 

~ Recursion
	- A recursive subprogram is one that includes, among the statements making the subprogram, a call to the same subprogram
	- It will continuously call itself recursively, hence there is a need for a stopping condition
	- This stopping condition acts as a decider between calling the subprogram again or finshing it

~ Advantages
	- Short and simple to write

~ Disadvantages 
	- Requires alot of memory
	- Difficult to debug / follow
	- Will crashed if the recursion continues too long
	- Sometimes very slow due to repeatedly storing and retrieving address and value
	- infinite loop if error ( may lead to crashing )
