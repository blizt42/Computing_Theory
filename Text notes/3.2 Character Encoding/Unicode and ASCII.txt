3.2.1 Give examples of where or how Unicode is used. 

~ Unicode
	- 8-32 bits ( up to 4 bytes ) per character
	- represents characters from all around the world ( chinese, tamil )

~ Advantages of Unicode
	- Used to handle documents with mulitple languages
	- Localisation of software
	  Standard software can be adapted and used by different cultures by modifying the layout and features of the interface
	- Represents all the characters used by the world's language ( up to 4 bytes , 32 bits)


~ ASCII
	- 7 bit set of codes that allows 128 different characters
	- Since computers store each char as a byte (8 bits) ASCII is also stored in 8 bit.

~ Advantages of ASCII
	- Occupies less space than Unicode
	- Simple to handle unlike Unicode

~ Extended ASCII
	- ASCII that represents 256 chars
	- range ( 0 - 255 )
