1.1.4 Use decision tables to explore the actions for combinations of different input conditions. Note: up to three conditions 

~ Decision table
	- Guides the programmer to produce the correct outcome based on the requirements
	- A precise way of modelling logic
	- Helps to organise the possible decision outcome combination
	- more convenient than a flowchart

~ Basic format of decision table
	- Top left: Conditions tested
	- Top right: Possible outcomes
	- Bottom left: Possible actions on conditions
	- Bottom right: action adopted on outcomes

~ Rules
	- for every decision, there are usually 2 outcomes
	- Therefore for N decision, there are 2^N outcomes


~ Advantage of using decision table
	- Possible to check all combination
	- Show the cause and effect relationship
	- Easy to trace from actions to conditions and vice versa
	- use of standard format (Easy to draw than flowchart)
	- Compact and easier to follow one column

~ limitations of using decision table
	- Large decision table can become hard to read and modify
	- Flowcharts are better to express the total sequence of events needed to solve a problem
	- Flowcharts are more familier to many programmers and beginners
