~ Modularisation
	- A process of dividing a problem into separate tasks, each with a single purpose
	- A simple solution algorithm.
	- define the problem, write down the control structures required to reach a solution and devise a solution algorithm
	- Uses a combination of sequence, selection, repetition control structures

~ Top down design / functional decomposition
	- The process in which a major task is first identified in a problem
	- The task is then split into smaller subtask and so on until it can be solved easily

~ Advantages of using Top down design (modular programming)
	- Pay attention to important properties while ignoring the non essential details ( Can look at a specific module only )
	- Faster programming and completion ( Multiple programmers can work on the problem, debugging etc )
	- Reusable work for another purpose ( Type once for one program, but can be used in other programs )
	- Different modules can be tested separately
