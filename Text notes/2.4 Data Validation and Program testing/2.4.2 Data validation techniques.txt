2.4.2 Understand data validation techniques such as:
	– range check
	– format check
	– length check
	– presence check
	– check digit. 

~ Presence Check
	- Field cannot be left blank
	- Ensures all fields are filled up
	- Eg: Surname field

~ Existence Check <>
	- Checks if a certain value is present
	- NOT THE SAME as Presence check, 
	Eg: number '2' is required
	    input value = 4
	    Presence check = Pass
	    Existence check  = Fail

~ Type Check <>
	- Checks data type
	- Ensures Data type of input is correct
	- Eg: Field must only have integers

~ Length check
	- Ensure data has the correct number of characters
	- Eg: Phone number has 8 characters

~ Range check
	- Ensure data value is within predetermined range
	- Eg: Month range (1-12), input < 1 and input > 12 is wrong

~ Format Check
	- Ensure Individual char in data is valid
	- Data must follow a pre-determined pattern
	- Eg: NRIC TXXXXXXXQ, X is integer, Pattern is first and last are letters, middle char are integers

~ Integrity check <>
	- Compare data entered with other data to confirm it
	- Eg: Birth date: today's year (2021) , input birth year (2069) which is incorrect.

~ Look Up check <>
	- Ensure data matches one of a limited number of valid entries
	- Eg: Product Code: Check with stock file to see if the code exist
	- Different from integrity check

~ Check Digit
	- Allows self-checking of a number
	- Used only in a large number to prevent mistype
	- Last 1 or 2 digits used as a check digit
	- The rest of the digits are computed to get a certain value to compare with the check digit
	
~ How does check digit work
	- number (XXXXYY) 
	- X are the integers to be calculated using a function to get a specific value (A)
	- YY is the check digit used to compare with the value calculated from XXXX, A
