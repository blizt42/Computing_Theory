2.4.1 Explain the difference between data validation and data verification.

~ Validation
	- The automatic checking of data entered into a computer system
	- Checks if the data is sensible
	- Captured data may not mean its the right data required (Cannot prove is data is right)
	- It helps identify the obviously wrong inputs

~ Verification
	- Checks if data entered has no transcription error
	- Checks if data entered is what you want to be entered
	- Why? Data entered may not be the same as the original data
	
	> transcription error
		- Made by human operators or OCR (Optical character recognition) programs
		- Eg: Fingers placed wrongly on keyboard
		- Electronic transcription error ( Printing on a crushed paper, font error )
		- Eg: You want to type in the word 'text', but you end up typing 'sext'.

	> transposition error
		- Characters in a string have been swapped (due to fast typing)
		- Eg: 'bye' --> 'bey'
	
	> Solving these errors
		- Watch the screen properly
		- Proof read input data
		- Use an input mask or validation rules (Eg: Only string characters allowed)
		- Double entry ( Data is Entered twice )
		- batch tools
		- check digits
		- control tools
		- hash totals

~ Differences between Validation and Verification
	- Data verification prevents errors when data is copied from medium to another.
	  It checks to see if there is any error when a data is transcribed and alerts the operator when they is, so they can correct it.
	- Data validation is the automactic checking of a data entered to see if it is sensible.
	  It has multiple types of checks to validate a data
