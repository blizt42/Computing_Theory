1.2.4 Use examples to explain search algorithms.
~ Order array
	- If the element is found, rest of array does not need to be seacrch
	- if array element > search element, no match found, rest of array does not need to be search

~linear search
	- Read search key and traverse the array from the start element
	- traverses the array until search key matches element
	- if last element not match, returns <element not found> and closes search

~binary search
	- cuts array in half for each pass
	- compares data at the half point ( search key == midpoint ??)
	- Can be in the form of resursion or dowhile algorithm
