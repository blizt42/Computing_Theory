1.2.2 Use examples to explain sort algorithms.
~ Sorting
	The arrangement of records into some sequential order according to an ordering criterion

~ Use of sorting
	- data in a sorted order is required
	- perform binary search or indexing a database
	- initialization step of many algorithms
	- Basically to make searching easier

~ Advantages of sorting
	- optimized searching
	- easy to read data
	- Processing data can be performed in a defined order

~ Type of sorts
	> Internal sort
		- Data is small enough to fit memory
		- Modifying order within the sequence
		- Eg: Insertion, Bubble, Quick sort
	
	> External sort
		- Data is too big for memory
		- Eg: Merge sort

~ Summary of sorting methods
	> Properties play an important role in determining speed of sort
		- number, size, distribution, and orderness
		- Amount of memory

	> When N is larger
		- Insertion faster than bubble
		- Quick is fastest
