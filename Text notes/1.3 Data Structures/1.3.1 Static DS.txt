~ Static
	- Arrays with fixed size ( Size cannot be modified while the program is running )
	- Suitable for storing items such as ( Months, Monthly sales, avg monthly temperature )
~ Disadvantage of static
	- Array size must be decided in advance
	- Full array means no more item can be added
	- Less efficient than dynamic DS

~ Static uses the stack area
