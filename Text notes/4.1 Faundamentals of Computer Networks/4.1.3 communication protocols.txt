4.1.3 Explain the need for communication protocols in a network. 

~ TCP/IP model (communication protocol)
	- Ensure the proper transfer of data between devices on networks
	- A protocol specifies the format of data, the signal to start, control and end the transfer
	- Eg: HTTP
	
	- Enables connection with any other computer connected to the internet regardless of its location
	- It tells how the signals are sent and provides transport and routing for the data over the network

	- Work as 4 connected layers, passing incoming and outcoming data up and down the layers
	- Each layer has varies protocol with different roles
	- Acts like delivering a parcel

~ Application layer ( Layer 1, Top )
	- Uses protocols relating to the application being used to transmit data over a network usually the internet
	- Eg: internet browser, will choose a suitable protocol, HTTP(for webpages), POP3(email) or FTP(file transfer)

~ Transport Layer ( Layer 2 )
	- Uses TCP to establish an end to end reliable connection with the recipient computer
	- Data is split into packets, labelled with packetnumber, total no. of packets and port number
	- Eg: HTTP protocol uses port 80
	
	- Any lost packets will be requested again for a retransmission by this layer

	- User datagram Protocol(UDP) is another protocol used here
	- It is the simplest communication protocol in this layer
	- Transfers packets smaller then TCP
	- Unreliable as recipent does not acknowledge and sender does not wait
	- Used in video streaming as packet loss does not have a big impact on video quality

~ Network Layer ( Layer 3 ) aka Internet layer
	- Adds the source and destination IP addresses to the packets
	- Routers operate in this layer

~ Link Layer ( Layer 4 )
	- The physical connection between network nodes
	- Uses MAC address to identify NICs of the source and destination computers
	- Adds the MAC address to the packets
	
	- After reaching the receiver end
	- Each layer unwraps the packet
	- If a layer adds something, it must also remove that thing
