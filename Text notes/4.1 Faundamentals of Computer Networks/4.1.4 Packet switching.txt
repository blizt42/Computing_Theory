4.1.4 Explain how data is transmitted in a packet-switching network. 

~ Packet switching
	- Data to be transmistted is broken down into small units known as packets that move in sequence through the network
	- Each packets takes the best route available throughout the transfeer
	- It assumes that the network is constantly changing and adjustments need to be made
	  for network congestion or broken links
	
~ Connectionless service
	- A packet is sent without knowledge if receiver is ready to accept it

~ connection-oriented service
	- first Packet sent includes a request for acknowledgement
	- if no acknoledgement,  it tries again with the first packet
	- if acknowledged, it sents the other packets
