4.1.5 Explain client-server architecture. 

~ Client-Server network
	- one or more computers, known as clients are connected to a powerful central server know as the server

~ File server
	- Holds and manages data for all the clients

~ Print server
	- Prints request

~ Web server
	- Manages requests to access the Web

~ Mail server
	- Manages the email system

~ Database server
	- Manages DB applications

~ Advantages of Client-server
	- Better sercurity ( All files stored there, access right managed by server )
	- Backsup done Centrally ( No need for indivdual users to backup )
	- Data and other resources can be shared
	- Easy to replace, upgrade or relocate clients as they do not affect other clients and the server ( independent)

~ Disadvantages of Client-Server
	- Expensive to install and maintain
	- Server overload if all clients simultaneously request data from server
	- Server fails, all clients cannot request data

~ Cloud computing
	- A service-based industry which provides access to software or files via the internet
	- Software as a service (SaaS)
	- Eg: Google drive, dropbox

~ Data Processing
	-client send request, server should respond with the data requested or a suitable message otherwise

~ Client-side processing
	- Software on the client can process the information
	- Lighten the load of the server's processor
	- improved sercurity ( Avoids unneccessary data transfer )
	- Eg: JavaScript used for interactivity in the webpage

~ Server-side processing
	- Faster processing than client
	- Specfic languages like SQL
	- client's JS may fail so validation on server side is important

~ Differences between server and client processing
	- client is front end processing
	- server is back end processing

~ Thin vs thick client computing
	- The more the processing is done by server, the lesser the client has to process
	- vice versa
	- Thinnest client processing = Dumb terminal
