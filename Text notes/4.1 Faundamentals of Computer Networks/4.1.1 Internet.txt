4.1.1 Explain the concepts of LAN, WAN, intranet and the structure of the internet. 

~ internet
	- a network of networks set up to allow communication between computers globally
	- Uses backbone cables connected by trans-continental leased lines fed across the sea bed

~ Uniform resource locators (URLs)
	- http://www.domainname.com/folder/subfolder/webpage.html#element
	Where
		http:// = Protocol for accessing resources
		www.domain.name = domain name
		folder/subfolder = path to resource
		webpage.html = filename with any extension required
		#element = Fragment, a portion or the document being displayed


~ Internet registrars
	- Holds all records of exisiting website names and those available to purchase

~ Interent registries
	- Hold records of all domains currently issued to individuals and companies
	- A group of 5 global orgs governed by ICANN

~ Local Area Network (LAN)
	- Computer systems are situated relatively close to each other
	- Network connections are normally wire cables, wireless links or fibre optic cable
	- Transmit data fast but only over a short distance
	- Usually serves a single organisation

~ Types of LAN (Network topologies)
	> Physical bus
		- connect all computers with one cable	
		- If one station fails, the rest wont work
	
	> Physical star
		- connect all computers to a central node, aka a switch
		- if one station fails, the others will still work 
		- More expensive than bus as require more cable

	> Ring
		- connect all comupters in a loop

	> Mesh Network
		- connect all computer wirelessly
		- More nodes, faster

~ Wide Area Network (WAN)
	- Dependent on telecoms provider
	- Computer systems are situated geographically remote (not close to each other)
	- Makes use of connection methods ( Telephone links, undersea cables, communication satelites )
	- Usually expensive and speed is limited
	- Links multiple LAN in a geographically spreaded areas, usually for MNCs

~ Intranet
	- Acts like the internet but only communicates solely within a particular company/ org
	- For sercurity , it is only available to users connnected to the company's network or by VPN

~ Virtual Private Network
	- A secure, point to point connection from a device to a network over the internet
	- Creates encrypted channels to allow safe transmission of sensitive data
