2.5.2 Understand encapsulation and how classes support information hiding and implementation
independence. 

~ information hiding
	- As a general rule, instance variables are declared private and most methods public
	- This means other class can use methods belonging to another class but are not allowed to access and modify its attributes
	- Attributes must only be modified through its accessor or modifier methods

~ Encapsulation
	- Combining attributes and methods into a single object type
	- Even if 2 objects are instantiated from the same class, the attributes and behaviours of one object cannot affect the way in which another object functions
	- Eg: 2 bank accounts, A and B
	      A can access and modify its cash balance, but cannot access and modifies B's cash balance
	- a mini sandbox
