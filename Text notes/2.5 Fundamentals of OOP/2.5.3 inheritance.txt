2.5.3 Understand inheritance and how it promotes software reuse.

~ inheritance
	- Definition: The ability for one class to acquire attributes or methods from a parent class or higher
	- One class inherits the data and behaviour from a parent class
	- A 'child' class is referred to as a subclass
	- A 'Parent' class is referred to as superclass
	- A hierachy relationship exists betwen classes (sub and superclass, base class and derived class)
	- Eg: Superclass-attribute A, subclass1-attribute B, subclass-attribute C
	      object1(subclass1)-attributes AB, Object2(subclass2)-attributes AC
	- Use 'is a' rule to check if subclass is from a super class (is a father a male?)

	- It is use to create a class by using existing class, which means one does not have to write an entire new class
